      "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making remarkable progress in recent years, attracting the attention of the public and highlighting the enormous potential these technologies have in empowering us to achieve the extraordinary. This potential goes beyond just algorithms; it promises to usher in a new era of economic growth, social progress, and innovative means of expression and connection. At Meta, we strongly believe in an open approach to AI development, particularly in the ever-evolving landscape of generative AI. By openly sharing AI models, we can extend their benefits to all levels of society. As part of this belief, we have recently released Llama 2, a large language model that is now open source and accessible to businesses, startups, aspiring entrepreneurs, and researchers. In this blog, we will discuss five steps for you to get started with Llama 2 and take advantage of its benefits in your own projects. We will cover the key concepts, how to set it up, available resources, and provide you with a step-by-step process to implement and run Llama 2.\n",

      "Introduction:\n",
      "Llama 2 includes model weights and starting code for pre-trained and fine-tuned large language models, with parameter ranges from 7B to 70B. Llama 2 has been trained on 40% more data than Llama 1 and has double the context length. The model was pre-trained on publicly available online data sources and fine-tuned using publicly available instruction datasets and over 1 million human annotations, using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to ensure safety and helpfulness. Llama 2 has outperformed other open language models on various external benchmarks, including reasoning, coding, proficiency, and knowledge tests. For more detailed information on these benchmarks, visit our website. Llama 2 is free for research and commercial use. In the following section, we will discuss five steps you can take to start using Llama 2. There are various ways to set up Llama 2 locally; we will discuss one of these ways, which will make it easier and faster to set up and start using Llama.\n",
